# HookFunction
Lua script designed for use with the Synapse X exploit framework. The script utilizes the hookfunction function to intercept HTTP requests made by the syn.request function. The primary purpose of this hook is to implement URL whitelisting, allowing users to specify a particular part of the URL to be checked against a whitelist.
